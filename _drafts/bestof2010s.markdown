One hope for the blog here is to write about others work, especially work that
I like quite a bit. This is somewhat motivated by Pieter Belmans [Fornightly
Links](https://pbelmans.ncag.info/blog/tags#fortnightly-links)
series, but it will take on its own twist here as I start by saying something
about the recent developments in K-theory I think are the most important.

Each of the main topics below will get its own post and I will compile the
links here as they are written.

A universal property for algebraic K-theory

# $$p$$-adic methods and the reformulation of cyclotomic spectra

# The solution to Weibel's conjecture

# Honorable mention

  - Asok--Hoyois--Wendt

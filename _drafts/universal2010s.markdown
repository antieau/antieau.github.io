One of the most important lines of thought in the last 10 or so years has been
the characterization of algebraic $$\K$$-theory as an invariant of stable
$$\infty$$-categories. This remarkable theorem was proved by Andrew Blumberg,
David Gepner, and Goncalo Tabuada in [bgt13], following related work in the
setting of dg categories by Tabuada and Cisinski--Tabuada. Other version
have appeared, in the case of $R$-linear stable $\infty$-categories by
Hoyois--Scherotzke--Sibilla and in the case of so-called Waldhausen
$$\infty$$-categories by Barwick.

All of these invariants generalize the universal property of Grothendieck's
$$\K_0$$ functor, which is the universal home for Euler characteristics.
However, the work of the authors above externalizes this property and finds
the universal property of algebraic $$\K$$-theory *as a functor*.

This style of thinking has revolutionized how we think about algebraic
$$\K$$-theory as well as related invariants like Hochschild homology
$$\HH(-/\bZ)$$, topological cyclic homology $$\TC$$, and any other
noncommutative invariant.

The most satisfying aspect of these theorems is that they get at what algebraic
$$\K$$-theory really is. But, they have important theoretical implications as
well. Here are two things that one can do the universal properties.

First, one can settle once and for all how algebraic $$\K$$-theory interacts
with symmetric monoidal structures or more generally $\bE_n$-monoidal
structures, where $\bE_n$ denotes the little $$n$$-disks operad. If $\Escr$ is
an $\bE_n$-monoidal stable $\infty$-category, then $\K(\Escr)$ naturally admits
the structure of a $\bE_{n-1}$-algebra in spectra. In particular, if $\Escr$ is
$\bE_\infty$, then $\K(\Escr)$ is $\bE_\infty$. This resolves a huge amount of
confusion and ambiguity in the literature.

Mention [bgt2]. See also [ggn].

Second, one can show that all possible constructions of the trace map
$\K\rightarrow\TC$ agree.

Open problem: are localizing motives compactly generated?

# Titles and abstracts

**Arvidsson**, _Properties of log canonical singularities in positive characteristic_.
We will investigate if some well known properties of log canonical singularities over the complex numbers still hold true over perfect fields of positive characteristic and over excellent rings with perfect residue fields.
We will discuss both pathological behavior in characteristic p as well as some positive results for threefolds.
We will see that the pathological behavior of these singularities in positive characteristic is closely linked to the failure of Kodaira-type vanishing theorems in positive characteristic.
Additionally, we will explore how these questions are related to the moduli theory of varieties of general type.

This is based on joint work with F. Bernasconi and Zs. Patakfalvi, as well as joint work with Q. Posva.

**Frei**, _Symplectic involutions of Kummer-type fourfolds_.
The middle cohomology of hyperkahler fourfolds of Kummer type was studied by Hassett and Tschinkel, who showed that a large portion is generated by cycle classes of fixed loci of symplectic involutions. In recent joint work with Katrina Honigs, we study Kummer-type fourfolds over arbitrary fields which arise as moduli spaces of stable sheaves on an abelian surface. We have extended the results of Hassett and Tschinkel and characterized the Galois action on the even cohomology. We do this by giving an explicit description of the symplectic involutions on the fourfolds. This has natural consequences for derived equivalences between Kummer fourfolds.

**Halpern-Leistner**, _The noncommutative minimal model program_.
There are many situations in which the derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth projective variety admits a semiorthogonal decomposition that reflects something interesting about its geometry.
I will present a new unifying framework for studying these semiorthogonal decompositions using Bridgeland stability conditions.
Then, I will formulate some conjectures about canonical flows on the space of stability conditions that imply several important conjectures on the structure of derived categories, such as the D-equivalence conjecture and Dubrovin's conjecture.

**Illusie**, _Non-decomposability of the de Rham complex and non-semisimplicity of the Sen operator, after A. Petrov_.
Let $k$ be a perfect field of characteristic $p>0$.
A. Petrov has recently constructed a projective, smooth scheme $X/W(k)$, of relative dimension $p+1$,
such that the Hodge to de Rham spectral sequence of $X_0 = X \otimes k$ does not degenerate at $E_1$,
thus solving a question raised by Deligne-Illusie in 1987. In addition, Petrov showed that the Sen operator of Bhatt-Lurie on $X_0$ is not semisimple.
The purpose of this and the next lecture is to give an idea of the main points and techniques in the proofs,
as well as to discuss a number of related results pertaining to de Rham cohomology of smooth schemes over $k$ and their liftings over $W_2(k)$ or $W(k)$.
I will present Petrov's example, and give an idea of the strategy of its proof. In particular, for $X_0/k$ smooth, lifted to $X_1$ over $W_2(k)$,
I will state Petrov's basic formula relating the first possibly non-trivial extension class in the canonical filtration of the de Rham complex of $X_0/k$
to the obstruction to lifting Frobenius of $X_0$ to $X_1$ and a certain cohomology class arising from the discrepancy between $S^p$ and $\Gamma^p$.

**Kedlaya**, _Algebraic Frobenius structures_.
Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over $Q$. Let $Z$ be a strict normal crossings divisor on $X$.
Then for any vector bundle $E$ on $X$ equipped with a logarithmic (for $Z$) integrable connection, for almost all primes $p$
we construct another vector bundle with logarithmic connection which interpolates the pullbacks along all analytic Frobenius lifts on $X$
(in a sense which we will make precise in the talk). In particular, when the connection is of geometric origin, we obtain an isomorphism of vector bundles with connection which constitutes an "algebraic Frobenius structure".
Conversely, in certain cases one can establish this isomorphism directly to show that E is an isocrystal, e.g.,
when the connection is rigid (recovering a result of Esnault-Groechenig) or superrigid (extending work of Klevdal-Patrikis). Moreover, in certain examples the algebraic Frobenius structures for *different* primes fit together in a manner that as yet lacks a general explanation.

**Lurie**, _Deligne-Illusie from the Prismatic Perspective_.
Let X be a projective algebraic variety over the field of complex numbers. A central result of Hodge theory is that every cohomology class on X can be represented (uniquely) by a harmonic differential form. This has an algebraic consequence: the Hodge-to-de-Rham spectral sequence of X degenerates. In the late 1980's, Deligne and Illusie gave a purely algebraic proof of the latter statement, using positive characteristic algebraic geometry in place of classical Hodge theory. In this talk, I'll describe some recent joint work with Bhargav Bhatt which offers a new point of view on
the work of Deligne-Illusie, using the theory of prismatic cohomology.

**Mathew**, _Nonconnective animated rings and affine stacks_.
I will discuss a theory of "derived rings" (a nonconnective
generalization of animated or simplicial commutative rings) and their
connection with affine stacks in the sense of Toen. Based on joint
work with Bhargav Bhatt, work of Arpon Raksit, and joint work with
Shubhodip Mondal.

**Mondal**, _Unipotent homotopy theory of schemes_.
Building on Toen's work on higher (affine) stacks,
I will discuss a notion of homotopy theory for algebraic varieties, which we call `unipotent homotopy theory'.
Over a field of char. $p>0$, I will explain how our unipotent homotopy group schemes recover
(1) unipotent completion of the Nori fundamental group scheme, (2) $p$-adic 'etale homotopy groups,
and (3) certain formal group laws arising from algebraic varieties constructed by Artin--Mazur.
Time permitting, I will discuss unipotent homotopy types of Calabi--Yau varieties and show that the unipotent homotopy group schemes $\pi^U_i$ of Calabi--Yau varieties (of dimension n)  are derived invariant for all $i$; the case $i = n$ corresponds to a recent result of Antieau--Bragg.
This is joint work with Emanuel Reinecke.

**Nizioł**, _Duality theory for p-adic pro-etale cohomology of analytic curves_.
It is well known that local Tate duality extends to $p$-adic etale cohomology of schemes over local fields.
In a joint work with Pierre Colmez and Sally Gilles we conjecture that it also extends to p-adic pro-etale cohomology of analytic spaces and prove it for analytic curves. I will discuss this work and, if time permits, its geometric analog.

**Ogus**, _Diffracting prisms: resolution of a quandary_.
Let $X/k$ be a smooth scheme over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p > 0$ and let $W$ be the Witt ring of $k$.
Inspired by Drinfeld’s ''stacky'' approach to prismatic cohomology, Bhatt, Lurie, and others have shown that a lifting of $X/k$ to $W$ induces a canonical action of the divided power version of $\Gm$ on $R\Gamma(X,\Omega^\bullet_{X/k})$. The $\bZ/p\bZ$-grading associated to the restriction of this action to $\mu_p$ generalizes the Deligne--Illusie decomposition theorem. I will explain several explicit geometric constructions of this action and how discussions with Bhatt and Vologodsky clarified the relationships among them. This will not be a formal research talk, but rather a story still in progress.

**Olsson**, _Homological descent and base change for stacks_.
Classically for a morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ of schemes the functor $$f_!:D(X)\rightarrow D(Y)$$ on derived categories of \'etale sheaves is defined using compactifications and ordinary pushforward $$f_*$$ for proper morphisms.
Verdier duality relates this functor to $f_*$, and this observation was used in earlier joint work with Laszlo to define $f_!$ for a morphism of algebraic stacks.
However, this approach has some deficiencies; in particular, it does not readily give the proper base change theorem in the context of stacks.
The base change theorem was subsequently proven by Liu and Zheng using other methods.
In this talk I will explain an alternate approach to $f_!$, which in particular gives the proper base change theorem, based on homological descent - a theory whose existence was suggested by Gabber some years ago.
This is joint work with Bhargav Bhatt.

**Petrov**, _Non-decomposability of the de Rham complex and non-semisimplicity of the Sen operator II_.
This is a continuation of Luc Illusie's talk.
I will describe a general algebraic approach to analyzing extensions in the canonical filtration on a complex admitting a certain special type of a derived commutative algebra structure, applicable e.g.
to diffracted Hodge complex of a smooth scheme over $W(k)$,
or de Rham, Hodge, or etale cohomology of an abelian scheme.
The approach relies on the analog of Steenrod operations for these derived commutative algebras.
As an application, we will see a discrepancy between equivariant Hodge and de Rham cohomology of an abelian variety equipped with an action of a discrete group.
This discrepancy gives rise to an example of a liftable variety with a non-degenerate Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence.

**Schwede**, _Perfectoid signature and an application to étale fundamental groups_.
In characteristic $p > 0$ commutative algebra, the $F$-signature measures how
close a strongly $F$-regular ring is from being non-singular. Here $F$-regular singularities are a characteristic $p > 0$
analog of klt singularities. In this talk, using the perfectoidization of Bhatt--Scholze, we will introduce a mixed
characteristic analog of $F$-signature and Hilbert--Kunz multiplicity.
As an application, we show it can be used to provide an explicit upper bound on the size of the étale fundamental group of the regular locus of a
BCM-regular singularities (related to results of Xu, Braun, Zhuang, Carvajal--Rojas, Tucker, Bhatt--Gabber--Olsson, and others in characteristic zero and characteristic p). BCM-regular singularities, as introduced by Pérez-R.G. and Ma and myself, can be thought of as a mixed characteristic analog of klt and
$F$-regular singularities from characteristic zero or $p > 0$ respectively. This is joint work with Hanlin Cai, Seungsu Lee, Linquan Ma and Kevin Tucker.

**Witaszek**, _Singularities in mixed characteristic via the Riemann-Hilbert
correspondence_.
In my talk, I will start by reviewing how various properties
of characteristic zero singularities can be understood topologically
by ways of the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. After that, I will
explain how similar ideas can be applied in the study of mixed
characteristic singularities. This is based on a joint work (in
progress) with Bhargav Bhatt, Linquan Ma, Zsolt Patakfalvi, Karl
Schwede, Kevin Tucker, and Joe Waldron.

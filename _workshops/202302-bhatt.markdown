# Organizers

Benjamin Antieau, Bao Le Hung, and Yuchen Liu.

# Registration

Please register **[here](https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/algebraic-geometry-and-cohomology-registration/)**. Note: no additional funding is possible.

*Warning*: there might be a spam email going out to some people about conference hotel booking. 
We will announce details from our `@northwestern.edu` addresses when the time comes.

# Funding

Some support is available for reimbursing participants' lodging and travel expenses.
This support is primarily for students and postdocs. Decisions were to be made by 28 February 2023,
but will be a few days late; they will be sent out on 13 March 2023.

# Lodging

All participants are asked to book their own hotel, whether or not they will be
reimbursed. The talks conference will take place at the
**[Hilton Orrington](https://www.hilton.com/en/attend-my-event/ordoehf-num-6e19d02f-2110-4546-ab33-030a64a06719/)**;
the link gives access to a special rate for rooms available until 1 May 2023.

# Travel

Northwestern is accessible via Amtrak through Chicago Union Station and via plane through Chicago O'Hare or
Midway airports. One can take a cab from any of these stations or take public transportation on the Red or
Purple 'L' Lines or on the **[UP-N
Line](https://ridertools.metrarail.com/maps-schedules/train-lines/UP-N)** of the Metra.

# Parking

Parking is available at either the South or North Campus Parking Garage for $9/day. The South Garage is a 5-10 minute walk from 
the location of the conference, the North Garage is a 15-20 minute walk. More options are available, but for these a pass must be purchased at the parking office at the South Campus
garage. For more details, see
[here](https://www.northwestern.edu/transportation-parking/evanston-parking/).


# Room

Talks will take place in the Orrington Room at the Hilton Orrington.

# Titles and abstracts

**Kedlaya**, _Algebraic Frobenius structures_.
Let X be a smooth projective variety over Q. Let Z be a strict normal crossings divisor on X. Then for any vector bundle E on X equipped with a logarithmic (for Z) integrable connection, for almost all primes p we construct another vector bundle with logarithmic connection which interpolates the pullbacks along all analytic Frobenius lifts on X (in a sense which we will make precise in the talk). In particular, when the connection is of geometric origin, we obtain an isomorphism of vector bundles with connection which constitutes an "algebraic Frobenius structure". Conversely, in certain cases one can establish this isomorphism directly to show that E is an isocrystal, e.g., when the connection is rigid (recovering a result of Esnault-Groechenig) or superrigid (extending work of Klevdal-Patrikis). Moreover, in certain examples the algebraic Frobenius structures for *different* primes fit together in a manner that as yet lacks a general explanation.

**Mondal**, _Unipotent homotopy theory of schemes_.
Building on Toen's work on higher (affine) stacks, I will discuss a notion of homotopy theory for algebraic varieties, which we call `unipotent homotopy theory'. Over a field of char. p>0, I will explain how our unipotent homotopy group schemes recover (1) unipotent completion of the Nori fundamental group scheme, (2) p-adic 'etale homotopy groups, and (3) certain formal group laws arising from algebraic varieties constructed by Artin--Mazur. Time permitting, I will discuss unipotent homotopy types of Calabi--Yau varieties and show that the unipotent homotopy group schemes \pi^U_i of Calabi--Yau varieties (of dimension n)  are derived invariant for all i; the case i = n corresponds to a recent result of Antieau--Bragg. This is joint work with Emanuel Reinecke.

**Schwede**, _Perfectoid signature and an application to étale fundamental groups_.
In characteristic p > 0 commutative algebra, the F-signature measures how
close a strongly F-regular ring is from being non-singular. Here F-regular singularities are a characteristic p > 0 analog of klt singularities. In this talk,
using the perfectoidization of Bhatt-Scholze, we will introduce a mixed
characteristic analog of F-signature and Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity. As an application, we show it can be used to provide an explicit upper bound on the size of the étale fundamental group of the regular locus of a BCM-regular singularities (related to results of Xu, Braun, Zhuang, Carvajal-Rojas, Tucker, Bhatt-Gabber-Olsson, and others in characteristic zero and characteristic p). BCM-regular singularities, as introduced by Pérez-R.G. and Ma and myself, can be thought of as a mixed characteristic analog of klt and F-regular singularities from characteristic zero or p > 0 respectively. This is joint work with Hanlin Cai, Seungsu Lee, Linquan Ma and Kevin Tucker.

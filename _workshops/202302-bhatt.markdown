# Organizers

Benjamin Antieau, Bao Le Hung, and Yuchen Liu.

# Registration

Please register **[here](https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/algebraic-geometry-and-cohomology-registration/)**. Note: no additional funding is possible.

*Warning*: there might be a spam email going out to some people about conference hotel booking. 
We will announce details from our `@northwestern.edu` addresses when the time comes.

# Funding

Some support is available for reimbursing participants' lodging and travel expenses.
This support is primarily for students and postdocs. Decisions were to be made by 28 February 2023,
but will be a few days late; they will be sent out on 13 March 2023.

# Lodging

All participants are asked to book their own hotel, whether or not they will be
reimbursed. Evanston has several hotels within walking distance of Northwestern, including
**[Hyatt House Evanston](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/illinois/hyatt-house-chicago-evanston/chixe?src=corp_lclb_gmb_seo_chixe)**,
**[Hilton Garden Inn Evanston](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/ordevgi-hilton-garden-inn-chicago-north-shore-evanston/)**, and
**[Hilton Orrington](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/ordoehf-hilton-orrington-evanston/)**.
The nicest is probably Hyatt House.

# Travel

Northwestern is accessible via Amtrak through Chicago Union Station and via plane through Chicago O'Hare or
Midway airports. One can take a cab from any of these stations or take public transportation on the Red or
Purple 'L' Lines or on the **[UP-N
Line](https://ridertools.metrarail.com/maps-schedules/train-lines/UP-N)** of the Metra.

# Parking

Parking is available at either the South or North Campus Parking Garage for $9/day. The South Garage is a 5-10 minute walk from 
the location of the conference, the North Garage is a 15-20 minute walk. More options are available, but for these a pass must be purchased at the parking office at the South Campus
garage. For more details, see
[here](https://www.northwestern.edu/transportation-parking/evanston-parking/).


# Room

Talks will take place in the Great Room at 600 Haven Street.

**Lisbon** (2018, 2023).
- Time Out Market.
- Black Sheep Lisboa. A wine bar. Take your glasses into the park.
- Castelo de São Jorge.
- Senhor Uva: great vegetarian restaurant.
- Jardim Botânico de Lisboa.
- Two mid-range, small hotels in good locations:
    - [Casa Das Janelas Com Vista](https://www.casadasjanelascomvista.com/) is charming with great views from Room 7; I've stayed twice.
    - [Casa Do Jasmim](https://www.shiadu.com/casa-do-jasmim/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=mybusiness-website) is in a slightly
more convenient location (a couple blocks away), but is not quite as perfect inside.
- Get a public transit pass and ride everywhere. Buses, trams, and trains are all easy, including to
Cascais and Sintra.
- Bird in the Tagus estuary with [Birds and Nature Tours in Portugal](https://www.birds.pt/).

**Cascais** (2018).
- Beach by the train.
- Then, take a cab or bike to Praia do Guincho to see the transition to the Atlantic.

**Sintra** (2023).
- Castelo dos Mouros.
- Jardins do Parque da Pena.

**Faro** (2023).
- Bird in Ria Formosa.
- Rent bikes from [Formosamar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1tM337U56Ngn7Fje7) and bike to Gigi's beach.
- [Ferry](https://www.passeios-ria-formosa.com/destinations/carreira-faro-ilha-de-faro/) to Faro beach.
- [Airbnb apartment](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/50525440?source_impression_id=p3_1694812166_CANhEgPfrHItT7LB) is a 2-minute walk outside the main hustle and bustle.
- [Drive4Miles](http://www.drive4miles.com/en/Default.aspx), my new favorite rental car company.
There's an airport office and one by the train station.

**Sagres** (2023).
- The best place.
- Laundry Lounge Sagres. Food, drinks, laundry.
- Mar Ilimitado for pelagic birding and cetaceans.
- Rota Vicentina, amazing backpacking trail along Western coast. We hiked from Aljezur down to swim at Praia de Amoreira.
- FERMENTO. Excellent mediteranean restaurant.
- Three Little Birds, a burger bar.
- Nemmo Sagres, a fairly fancy hotel which was worth it, at least from Room 324.

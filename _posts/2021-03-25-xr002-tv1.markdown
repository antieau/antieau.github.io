This post is on the recent paper [\[2\]](#tv1) of Toën and Vezzosi on the
Riemann--Hilbert correspondence for derived foliations.

There are two versions of the Riemann--Hilbert correspondence. The first, more
classical form, deals with algebraic differential equations with regular
singularities on a smooth complex
manifold $U$ and relates these to local systems of finite dimensional complex vector spaces on $U$, i.e., complex representations of $\pi_1(U)$. The second, strictly more general, treats regular
holonomic $D$-modules and relates these to constructible sheaves on $U$.
In [\[2\]](#tv1), Toën and Vezzosi prove a massive generalization of the
classical Riemann--Hilbert correspondence for local systems.



# Derived foliations

**Definition**. Let $R$ be a connective[^a] cdga over $\bC$. A derived foliation
$\Fscr$ over $R$ is a complete filtered cdga $\F^\star\dR_\Fscr$ with a map
to $R$ such that
 - $\gr^s\dR_\Fscr\we 0$ for $s<0$,
 - $\gr^0\dR_\Fscr\we R$ via the fixed map above,
 - $\gr^1\dR_\Fscr[1]$ is a perfect connective $R$-module, and
 - the natural map $$\Sym_R(\gr^1\dR_\Fscr)\rightarrow\gr^\star\dR_\Fscr$$
 is an equivalence.

The complex $\L_\Fscr:=\gr^1\dR_\Fscr[1]$ is called the cotangent
complex of $\Fscr$.

One wants derived foliations to form a geometric kind of
$\infty$-category, so let $Fol(R)$ be the *opposite* of the
$\infty$-category of derived foliations over $R$. The functions space
correspondence is then $$\dR_\Fscr\leftrightarrow\Fscr.$$
This notion globalizes and if $X$ is a scheme or later a complex analytic
space, one obtains $Fol(X)$, which is opposite to the $\infty$-category of
sheaves of quasicoherent derived foliations in the obvious sense.

I will test each idea in this exposition on the following four basic examples.

**Case A**. The $$\mathbf{0}_X$$ foliation is the unique foliation with $\L_\Fscr\we 0$. It
is the initial object of $Fol(X)$ and corresponds to the case where the
`leaves' are the points of $X$.

**Case B**. If $X$ is locally of finite presentation over $\bC$ as a derived scheme,[^b]
then the cotangent complex $\L_X$ is perfect so that the Hodge-complete derived de Rham cohomology $\dR_{X/\bC}$ is a derived foliation with cotangent complex the cotangent
complex of $X$.
This is the final object of $Fol(X)$ by the universal property of derived
de Rham cohomology. It corresponds to the foliation with a single leaf, $X$
itself. I will further restrict attention below to the case where $X$ is an
ordinary smooth scheme over $\bC$.

**Case C**. If $X\xrightarrow{f} Y$ is a morphism of smooth $\bC$-schemes, then the
Hodge-complete relative derived de Rham cohomology $\dR_{f}$ is a derived
foliation with cotangent complex $\L_f$. The leaves are the fibers of $f.$

**Case D**. If $\gfrak$ is a finite dimensional coconnective dg Lie algebra over
$\bC$, then the Chevalley--Eilenberg complex $\mathrm{CE}(\gfrak)$ is naturally
a derived foliation over $\bC$ with cotangent complex $\gfrak^\ast$, the
$\bC$-linear dual of $\gfrak$. At least if $\gfrak$ is an ordinary Lie algebra (not dg), this complex computes the Lie algebra cohomology
of $\bC$ over $\gfrak$ and the filtration arises as the Koszul dual of the
Poincaré--Birkhoff--Witt filtration on the universal enveloping algebra. There is only a single leaf of this foliation
and if $\gfrak$ is the tangent Lie algebra to an
algebraic group $G$ over $\bC$, then the leaf is equivalent to $G$ itself.
Indeed, in this case

$$\mathrm{CE}(\gfrak)\we\dR_{\ast/\B G},$$

the Hodge-complete derived de Rham cohomology of a point $\ast\we\Spec\bC$
over the classifying stack $\B G$.

Case D illustrates well that the `leaves' of a foliation are only well-defined
formally as different algebraic groups can share the same Lie algebra. It would
be better here to say that the leaf of $\mathrm{CE}(\gfrak)$ is the formal
group of $G$ at the origin.
I will not go into depth on the formal definition of the leaves of a foliation.
These are certain formal moduli problems and are indeed studied in the paper
[\[2\]](#tv1) of
Toën--Vezzosi, but they are not needed for the main story today.

The main theorem is about crystals over foliations.



# Crystals

Let $\Fscr$ be a derived foliation over $X$.

**Definition**. A **perfect crystal** over $\Fscr$ is a
$\F^\star\dR_\Fscr$-module $\F^\star M$ in sheaves of complete filtered complexes such $\gr^0M$ is a perfect complex of $\Oscr_X$-modules and such that
the natural map

$$\gr^\star\dR_\Fscr\otimes_{\Oscr_X}\gr^0M\rightarrow\gr^\star M$$

is a graded equivalence. Let $\Perf(\Fscr)$ denote the stable $\infty$-category
of perfect crystals over $\Fscr$. This is a rigid symmetric monoidal stable
$\infty$-category with a symmetric monoidal exact functor
$\gr^0\colon\Perf(\Fscr)\rightarrow\Perf(X)$.

The theory of crystals over foliations is further developed in [\[3\]](#tv2) and in [\[1\]](#t1).
In particular, a theory of Weyl algebras and differential operators is
developed in [\[3\]](#tv2).

**Case A**. The functor $\gr^0\colon\Perf(\mathbf{0}_X)\rightarrow\Perf(\Oscr_X)$ is an equivalence.

**Case B**. If $X$ is a smooth $\bC$-scheme, the stable $\infty$-category $\Perf(\dR_{X/\bC})$ is equivalent to the stable $\infty$-category of perfect complexes
with integrable connection, $\D^b(\mathrm{MIC}(X/\bC))$.

**Case C**. In this case, $\Perf(\dR_{X/Y})$ consists of integrable connections along $f$.

**Case D**. If $\gfrak$ is a finite-dimensional coconnective dg Lie algebra,
then $\Perf(\mathrm{CE}(\gfrak))\we\mathrm{Rep}_\gfrak(\Perf(\bC))$, the $\infty$-category of representations of
of $\gfrak$ in perfect complexes over $\bC$.



# Homotopy-coherent chain complexes

To a complete filtration $\F^\star M$ one can associate a homotopy-coherent
chain complex

$$\cdots\rightarrow\gr^{-1}M[-1]\rightarrow\gr^0M\rightarrow\gr^1M[1]\rightarrow\cdots,$$

which gives the $\E_1$-page of the spectral sequence upon taking cohomology.
From this perspective, a derived foliation over $R$ is a homotopy-coherent cdga
of the form

$$0\rightarrow R\rightarrow\L_\Fscr\rightarrow\Lambda^2\L_{\Fscr}\rightarrow\cdots.$$

If $\F^\star M$ is a perfect crystal over $\F^\star\dR_\Fscr$, then the
associated homotopy-coherent chain complex  looks like

$$0\rightarrow\gr^0M\xrightarrow{\nabla}\L_\Fscr\otimes_R\gr^0M\xrightarrow{\nabla}\Lambda^2\L_\Fscr\otimes_R\gr^0M\rightarrow\cdots.$$

Here, the fact that we have a homotopy-coherent chain complex means that there
is a canonical nullhomotopy $\nabla^2\we 0$, expressing **integrability** as
well as higher coherence data, necessary since $\gr^0M$ and $\L_\Fscr$ are
typically not discrete.

**Case A**. Nothing interesting to say here.

**Case B**. If $\F^\star M$ is a perfect crystal over $\F^\star_\H\dR_{X/\bC}$
corresponding to a perfect $\Oscr_X$-module with integrable connection $E$, then the homotopy-coherent chain complex is the de Rham complex of the connection:

$$0\rightarrow
E\xrightarrow{\nabla}\L_X\otimes_{\Oscr_X}E\xrightarrow{\nabla}\Lambda^2\L_X\otimes_{\Oscr_X}E\rightarrow\cdots.$$

**Case C**. This is a relative version of Case B, clearly. However, it makes
sense even when the fibers of the map are not smooth.

**Case D**. For $\F^\star M\in\Perf(\mathrm{CE}(\gfrak))$, the associated
homotopy-coherent chain complex is

$$\gr^0M\xrightarrow{\nabla}\gfrak^\ast\otimes_\bC\gr^0M\xrightarrow{\nabla}\Lambda^2(\gfrak^\ast)\otimes_\bC\gr^0M\rightarrow\cdots,$$

which computes the Lie algebra cohomology $\R\Gamma(\gfrak,\gr^0M)$ of the $\gfrak$-representation
$\gr^0M$.
Here, $\nabla$ is adjoint to the action map
$\gfrak\otimes_\bC\gr^0M\rightarrow\gr^0M$ of the corresponding
$\gfrak$-representation and the fact that $\nabla^2\we 0$ expresses the Jacobi
identity.



# The Riemann--Hilbert correspondence

Now, I can state the main theorem of [\[2\]](#tv2). First, note that if $X$ is
a smooth $\bC$-scheme, then for any foliation $\Fscr$ on $X$ there is a
corresponding holomorphic foliation $\Fscr^h$ on $X^h$. Let $\Oscr_{\Fscr^h}$
denote the sheaf of cdgas on $X^h$ obtained by taking the underlying object of
the filtration defined by the foliation. In other words, $\Oscr_{\Fscr^h}=\F^0\Fscr^h$.

Let $\Perf^\nil(\Fscr)\subseteq\Perf(\Fscr)$ be the full subcategory of perfect
crystals over $\Fscr$ which are locally in the analytic topology in the stable
subcategory generated by the unit $\Fscr$ itself. Similarly for
$\Perf^\nil(\Fscr^h)$.
Finally, let $\Perf(\Oscr_{\Fscr^h})$ denote the stable $\infty$-category of
sheaves of $\Oscr_{\Fscr^h}$-modules which are analytic-locally in the stable
subcategory generated by $\Oscr_{\Fscr^h}$.

**Theorem** (The Riemann--Hilbert correspondence). If $X$ is a smooth and proper $\bC$-scheme
and $\Fscr$ is a derived foliation on $X$ such that $\L_\Fscr$ has
Tor-amplitude in cohomological degrees $[-1,0]$, then the natural functor

$$\Perf^\nil(\Fscr)\rightarrow\Perf(\Oscr_{\Fscr^h})$$

is an equivalence.

The condition on the cotangent complex $\L_\Fscr$ in the theorem, called
**quasi-smoothness**, guarantees that $\H^n(\Oscr_{\Fscr^h})=0$ for $n<0$.

**Sketch of proof**. By GAGA (proved in the paper for this setting), the
natural map $\Perf(\Fscr)\rightarrow\Perf(\Fscr^h)$ is an equivalence of stable
$\infty$-categories, which induces an equivalence
$\Perf^\nil(\Fscr)\we\Perf^\nil(\Fscr^h)$ on subcategories of nilpotent
crystals. Now, $\Perf^\nil(\Fscr^h)\rightarrow\Perf(\Oscr_{\Fscr^h})$ is the
functor on global sections of a map of stacks
$\Perfscr^\nil(\Fscr^h)\rightarrow\Perfscr^\nil(\Oscr_{\Fscr^h})$. This map of
stacks is a local equivalence. Indeed, both sides are locally generated by the
unit object and by definition the sheaf of endomorphisms of the unit is
$\Oscr_{\Fscr^h}$. The theorem follows now by taking global sections. $\square$

I really like this fundamentally Morita-theoretic proof. To get finer
information, especially about which crystals are nilpotent, one needs a
foliated analogue of the Cauchy--Kovalevskaya theorem on existence and uniqueness of
solutions of linear partial differential equations. This is proved by Toën and Vezzosi
as Theorem 3.2.3 in [\[2\]](#tv1) for $\Fscr$-crystal structures on vector bundles on $X$ when $X$
is smooth, $\Fscr$ is quasi-smooth and **rigid** ($\H^0(\L_X)\rightarrow\H^0(\L_\Fscr)$ is surjective), and the singular locus of $\Fscr$ has codimension at least $2$.

**Corollary**. Suppose that $X$ is a smooth and proper $\bC$-scheme and that
$\Fscr$ is a rigid quasi-smooth foliation on $X$ with singular locus of
codimension at least $2$. The Riemann--Hilbert correspondence restricts to an
equivalence

$$\Perf^\mathrm{v}(\Fscr)\we\Perf^\mathrm{v}(\Oscr_{\Fscr^h}),$$

where $\Perf^\mathrm{v}(\Fscr)$ denotes the stable subcategory of $\Perf(\Fscr)$
generated by foliations of vector bundles and $\Perf^\mathrm{v}(\Oscr_{\Fscr^h})$
denotes the full subcategory of $\Perf(\Oscr_{\Fscr^h})$ generated by those which are locally free over $\Oscr_{\Fscr^h}$, or equivalently vector bundles on $U$ with integrable
connection and regular singularities.


**Case A**. This is the classical GAGA theorem. Here,
    $\Oscr_{\mathbf{0}_X}\we\Oscr_X^h$.

**Case B**. This is the classical Riemann--Hilbert correspondence of Deligne
applied to the smooth proper scheme $X$. In this case, $\Oscr_{\dR_{X/\bC}}$ is
the constant sheaf $\bC$ on $X^h$.

**Case C**. This is a relative Riemann--Hilbert correspondence.

**Case D**. The Riemann--Hilbert correspondence recovers the equivalence
between nilpotent crystals over $\mathrm{CE}(\gfrak)$ and perfect complexes
over the underlying cdga $\F^0\mathrm{CE}(\gfrak)$.

The beauty of this RH correspondence is that it applies not only in the
familiar Cases A-D, but to many other cases, which might not be
globally integrable. One example is when $X$ is a smooth proper
compactification of a smooth $\bC$-scheme $U$ with a simple normal crossing
divisor as complement. In this case, if $\Fscr$ is the foliation
corresponding to the log de Rham complex, then the corollary recovers Deligne's
theorem for the open $U$. In this case, $\Oscr_{\Fscr^h}$ is by Grothendieck
$j_*\bC$, where $j\colon U\hookrightarrow X$, and $\Perf^{\mathrm{v}}(\Fscr)$
is precisely the stable subcategory of $\Fscr$-crystals generated by vector
bundles on $X$ with a logarithmic connection along $D$.

<!--ąëéłü-->

A lot has happened in 2021. For myself, productivity was at an
all-time low for much of the year. But, mathematicians at large continued their
break-neck speed and a ton of interesting papers were written and posted; see
the 48 listed below.
Returning to campus in the fall sparked new activity and I have gotten a lot
done since then. Much of this work is bound up in a longer project which won't
see the light of day for a bit longer.

My PhD student Joel Stapleton successfully defended his PhD project which was
to prove that Weibel's conjecture on vanishing of K-theory holds for Azumaya
algebras; see his paper on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00266), which
will appear in the *Annals of K-Theory*.

Here are a few stats about work during the year.
I finished one [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04291) with Asher Auel on genus $1$ curves which we had been thinking about for five
years. I also wrote 19 recommendation letters of various forms, wrote 2 referee
reports (this is very low thanks to my sabbatical), and wrote 21 quick
opinions!

I wrote 12 blog posts here and read 40 or so non-math books, mostly novels, of which
the best by far were George Eliot's *Middlemarch*, James Baldwin's *Go Tell it
on the Mountain*, Arundhati Roy's *The God of Small Things*, and Fredrik
Backman's *Anxious People*. In terms of nonfiction, I enjoyed Ayad Akhtar's *Homeland
Elegies*, Tom Murphy's *Energy and Human Ambitions on a Finite Planet*, and
Michael Pollan's *Omnivore's Dilemma*.

I was excited to see that the [Stacks
Project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/) and especially Johan de Jong won the [Steele Prize](https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=6894) for
mathematical exposition from the AMS. This is a huge deal and hopefully will
encourage other bold, sweeping collaborative works. Next, I would like to see
the L-functions and modular forms database [LMFDB](https://www.lmfdb.org/) win
something because it is really the best.

syntomic complexes. Great pics.

approach to the curves in K-theory perspective on TR. See my [post]({%

Dahlhausen, *$K$-theory of admissible Zariski--Riemann spaces*,
    [arXiv:2101.04131](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04131). Algebraic $K$-theory
    of Zariski--Riemann spaces behaves an awfully lot like they are regular.

Kerz, Saito, and Tamme, *$K$-theory of non-archimedean rings II*,
    [arXiv:2103.06711](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06711).

    More intertwining of class field theory and $K$-theory.

Canoncao, Neeman, and Stellari, *Uniqueness of enhancements for derived and
geometric categories*, [arXiv:2101.04404](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04404).

Elmanto, Kulkarni, and Wendt, *$\bA^1$-connected components of classifying spaces
and purity for torsors*, [arXiv:2104.06273](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06273).
A subject close to my heart, this paper clarifies some things about extending
`unramified' $G$-torsors off of generic points. 

Lüders and Morrow, *Milnor $K$-theory of $p$-adic rings*,
    [arXiv:2101.01092](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01092).

Burghardt, *The dual motivic Witt cohomology Steenrod algebra*,
    [arXiv:2112.03156](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03156).
    Computes the algebra over, for example, quadratically closed fields of
    characteristic not $2$.

and the lattice conjecture*, [arXiv:2102.01566](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01566).
Some new cases of Blanc's lattice conjecture, largely using assembly techniques.

Burklund and Levy, *On the $K$-theory of regular coconnective rings*,
         [arXiv:2112.14723](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14723).
         The paper gives some nice results on vanishing of $K$-theory for
         coconnective ring spectra, whereas most results are for connective
         ring spectra. (It also corrects a gap in an argument in an example of
                 my negative $K$-theory paper with Gepner and Heller.)

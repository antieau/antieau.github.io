I am beginning a blog to discuss new developments in K-theory, Hochschild
homology, de Rham cohomology, and other topics I'm interested in. In
particular, I will be explaining examples, highlighting new work I think is
interesting, and discussing the major themes in the development of the subject.

Comments will be welcome via [email](mailto:antieau@northwestern.edu).

I owe thanks to [Pieter Belmans](https://pbelmans.ncag.info/) for getting me
set up on the technical side. The site is hosted on <tt>[Github
Pages](https://pages.github.com/)</tt> and run using the static site builder
<tt>[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)</tt> with a slightly customized version of the <tt>[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)</tt> theme.
Math is rendered via <tt>[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)</tt>.

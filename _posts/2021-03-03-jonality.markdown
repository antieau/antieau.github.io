[Asher Auel](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~auel/) and I have discussed the following definition, which is fun to think
about.

**Jonality**. Let $X$ be an algebraic variety over a field $k$. The *jonality*
of $X$ is the smallest $g$ such that there exists a smooth proper geometrically connected curve $C$ of genus $g$
defined over $k$ and a *non-constant* morphism $C\rightarrow X$.

Jonality is pronounced as in "Johan" plus "gonality".

The jonality of a curve of genus $g$ is ... $g$.

The jonality of projective space $\bP^r$ is $0$ since $\bP^r$ contains lines.

The jonality of a degree $d$ hypersurface $X$ in $\bP^r$ is at most the jonality of
a degree $d$ smooth plane curve, i.e., $\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$ since we can
intersect $X$ with $(r-2)$ generic hyperplanes. But, the jonality is typically
smaller: think of the lines in a cubic surface.

If $A$ is a simple abelian $g$-fold, its jonality is at least $g$. If
additionally $A$ is not isogeneous to a Jacobian, then the jonality is at least
$g+1$.

The jonality of K3 surfaces is interesting: apparently it is zero (at least over $\bC$).

The previous examples were geometric in nature. The jonality is also an
interesting arithmetic invariant. Asher Auel and I are working on the open problem of whether every Severi--Brauer variety $X$ defined over a field $k$ contains a (possibly singular
genus $1$ curve). In other words, we are asking whether the jonality of $X$ is
at most $1$. This was a question asked, in different terms, by Pete Clark and
David Saltman.

Let $D$ be a division algebra of degree $d$ and let $X$ be its
Severi--Brauer variety, an étale-twisted form of $\bP^{d-1}$. If $d=2$, then
$X$ is a genus $0$ curve so its jonality is $0$. If $d\geq 3$, then $X$ contains no
maps from any (geometrically) rational curve, so its jonality is at least $1$.

If $d=3,4,5$, then Johan de Jong and Wei Ho showed [\[1\]](#dejongho) that there is a genus $1$ curve
mapping to $X$; i.e., the jonality is $1$ in these cases. Auel has proved the
same result for $d=6$ using cohomological techniques to combine the cases of
$d=2,3$.

Above $d=6$, little is known in general. Recently, with an observation of Saltman, Auel
and I proved the following theorem.

**Theorem**. If $D$ is a division algebra of degree $7$ over a *global* field
of characteristic prime to $7$,
then $D$ is split by a genus $1$ curve; i.e., the jonality of the
Severi--Brauer variety of $D$ is $1$.

This result will appear in forthcoming work which also gives new examples in
degrees $8,9,10$. In the meantime, I would be very interested to hear of other
arithmetically interesting cases of jonality computations.

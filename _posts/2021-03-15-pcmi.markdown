I am a co-organizer, with Marc Levine, Oliver Röndigs, Alexander Vishik, and
Kirsten Wickelgren, of an exciting Park City Mathematics Institute Summer
School on **Motivic Homotopy** to take place *online* 12-16 July 2021. The school is
preparation for a longer program in motivic homotopy theory we are organizing some
future summer.

The speakers are Frédéric Déglise, Philippe Gille, Daniel Krashen, Matthew Morrow, and Kirsten Wickelgren, a truly fantastic lineup. Syllabi are available [here](https://www.ias.edu/pcmi/2021-graduate-summer-school-course-descriptions).

Applications are required and are accepted through 5 April 2021 [here](https://www.ias.edu/pcmi/programs/pcmi-2021-graduate-summer-school).

I hope to see many of you there.
